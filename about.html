    <h2>Laura Louise Ashcroft</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Laura, I'm 26 and live in the West Midlands. I have many different interests, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Playing Sports</li>
            <li>Walking Outdoors</li>
            <li>Growing Vegetables</li>
            <li>Gaming</li>
            <li>Binging Netflix</li>
            <li>Birdwatching</li>
            <li>Cooking</li>
            <li>Eating!</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I try to fill my days with as many of my hobbies as possible, and sometimes find it hard to sit still if I haven't got a task to be focused on. I try to be quite sporty and and have played competitively in tennis, football and American football. I'm hoping to keep at least some of this up while working at home for 16 weeks and be as active as possible. I live with my fiancée Helen, who also codes from home and is loving it!</p>

        <p>I have been working for the police for the last year in Forensic Science, using a variety of techniques to identify fingerprints from crime scene evidence. I did enjoy the laboratory work, however once you've seen one bloody machete, you have seem them all unfortunately. The novelty wore off after a while and I found myself almost working back towards my 'roots' and becoming interested in game development and physics engines.</p>

    <h4> Why Games?</h4>
        <p>I have always loved gaming and have been interested in it for many reasons:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>I am a major geek and will happily spend any free time I have playing video games.</li>
        <li>The landscapes and details on some video games are just beautiful and it always makes me wonder how it's done and how I could do it. (Can we stop to think about Red Dead Redemption 2 for a moment and sit in awe at that scene?)

        <li>Learning to play video games is a skill that can be developed and even envied - some children earn <a href="https://qz.com/1676648/a-teen-just-made-more-than-1-million-playing-fortnite/#:~:text=The%20teen%20gamer%2C%20known%20as,to%20eight%20hours%20a%20day">£2 million for winning at Fortnite!!</a></li>
        <li>Video games bring friends together and become something you have in common and can discuss.</li>
        <li>Video games show finally who is the best and who gets to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hHDxlm66dE">Finish Him.</a></li>
