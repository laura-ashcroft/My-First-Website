        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Laura, I'm 26 and live in the West Midlands. I have many different interests, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Playing Sports</li>
            <li>Walking Outdoors</li>
            <li>Growing Vegetables</li>
            <li>Gaming</li>
            <li>Binging Netflix</li>
            <li>Birdwatching</li>
            <li>Cooking</li>
            <li>Eating!</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I try to fill my days with as many of my hobbies as possible, and sometimes find it hard to sit still if I haven't got a task to be focused on. I try to be quite sporty and and have played competitively in tennis, football and American football. I'm hoping to keep at least some of this up while working at home for 16 weeks and be as active as possible. I live with my fianc√©e Helen, who also codes from home and is loving it!</p>
        <p>I have been working for the police for the last year in Forensic Science, using a variety of techniques to identify fingerprints from crime scene evidence. I did enjoy the laboratory work, however once you've seen one bloody machete, you have seem them all unfortunately. The novelty wore off after a while and I found myself almost working back towards my 'roots' and becoming interested in game development and physics engines.</p>
